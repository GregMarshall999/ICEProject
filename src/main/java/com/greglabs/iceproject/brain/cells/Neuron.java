 * The representation of a neuron.
 * Following a biological diagram the neuron is composed of 4 components:
 *      -Dendrites, collecting information
 *      -Soma, the body of the cell, processes information
 *      -Axon, a long cable like structure passing information through
 *      -Synapses, branched connection sending information to other neuron's dendrites
 * The information flows from the dendrites to the synapses through the components mentioned above
